### 📘 About the Book

The book provides a **comprehensive introduction** to the core concepts of programming logic and algorithm design. It uses **JavaScript** as the practical language for demonstrating these concepts.

Key topics covered include:

* **Fundamentals of Logic:** Understanding how to think logically to solve problems.
* **Algorithms:** Designing efficient step-by-step procedures to complete tasks.
* **Data Types and Variables:** Working with different kinds of information.
* **Control Structures:** Implementing decision-making (e.g., `if`/`else`) and repetition (e.g., `for`, `while` loops).
* **Functions and Procedures:** Organizing code into reusable blocks.
* **Arrays and Data Collections:** Managing lists of data.

### 💻 Project Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to:

1.  Provide **working solutions** for all exercises presented in the book.
2.  Serve as a **study aid** and practical reference for others learning programming logic with this material.
3.  Offer an opportunity to practice **clean, well-documented JavaScript** code.
